# ZeroToHero


How you could go from Zero to Hero with Crypto.

I will start by saying that currently there is a massive opportunity in crypto, these have always been volatile assets and you could lose what you put in but it really does feel to me like were at the start of something special, so you really don’t want to sit idle and let opportunities pass you by. 

Step 1.
Hustle for cash, yes we all have to get started somehow and unless you already have cash reserves you will need to get out there and make some. How can this be done fairly quickly? Well here are some ideas:
* Matched betting on sights like profitaccumulator.co.uk – I did this over lockdown and with introductory matched betting offers (sports betting offers) that you bet on for and against to make money from their sign up bonus. This can earn you around £250-350 within a few weeks of work.
* Ebay – sell anything and everything that is sitting around in your home making you no money. Trust me when we talk about the potential of Bitcoin or Altcoin’s then your old bike or coffee machine won’t seem so important to hang onto collecting dust.
* Working – any job with any wage will do as you will put everything you can afford to into the investments (remember now is the best time to do this) as anything you put away now could be worth 10X in the future.

Step 2. Have the cash on a debit card ready to be deployed on crypto apps such as: 

*Crypto.com 1.5% crypto purchase fees
https://crypto.com/app/2b5hnjwp46
*Swissborg 1% BTC purchase fees
join.swissborg.com/r/edwardF4HH

If your happy to pay more percentage in fees then go for exchanges such as Coinbase and Binance.

Step 3. 
Portfolio allocation – this all comes down to risk reward preference and in my view any sensible portfolio should be prominently BTC, ETH then Altcoins. The reason I say this is that BTC is being viewed now by institutions and smart money as a good hedge against the global printing of money and is viewed as a hard asset with a fixed supply (the only unique asset of its kind) and has already got an established market cap and network effects. Next bull run could be 10-15X your investment. Portfolio allocation 60-75%.

Ethereum is a global open-source platform for decentralized applications. It is not just a form of money but a way of guaranteeing trust. Any bit of centralised software currently existing today could be on boarded onto the Ethereum network in the future once the rate of transactions has increased and the platform has matured and with the success of ETH2.0 genesis launch we know this will be happing within the next few years. Next bull run anywhere from 20% less value than BTC all the way up to 20X. Portfolio allocation 20-35%.

Altcoins – If I were looking to invest in altcoins personally I would look at the potential that DeFi – decentralised finance has in the space. Some coins in that class would be ones such as MKR, UNI and SNX. Portfolio allocation 5-15%.

This is a rough guide on how to take the risk and downside potential of crypto out of the equation while keeping the huge upside potential. It goes over rough ideas on portfolio management but could be adjusted however you wish to meet your specific needs.
